# chaotic-logistic

Simple python script that iterates the logistic equation ( x1 = R * x0 * ( 1 - x0 ) ) for multiple values of R. Plots x against R on a pyplot graph.

This gives a graph that shows the non-linear behaviour, with bifurcation and chaotic regions.

To run the script, just run "python3 logistic_equation.py".
